# Kwiz
Kwiz is a web platform that provides educational quizzes with rewards for the participants.
Users can sign up and they will be able to play quizzes and compete against other participants by earning points and rewards.
The objective of the application is to provide a good game experience with an educational value.

## Kwiz Rules
* Each quiz contains multiple or single choice questions.
* Each quiz relates to one subject and has a specific level.
* These levels and subjects are defined by the admin who manages the platform.
* The platform allows users to publish their own quizzes. These contributors are appointed by the admin. They can also assist in the management of the platform.
* Each quiz has a lifecycle of 7 days. (from Monday to Sundy midnight)
* Only the first 3 participants who obtained 100% in the quiz will be rewarded.
* A quiz is closed as soon as 3 participants have earned 100% reward.
* A queue system is used where each contributor has only one available quiz and once it's completed by 3 participants or when the week ends it will be automatically replaced by the next quiz in that contributor's queue.
* There is a ranking system for participants where they can see their own position but also they can represent their team (school, universirty, organization etc...).
* Medals are used as a rewarding system where the first winner gets a gold medal, the second winner gets a silver medal and the third winner gets a bronze medal.
